# FastAPI baseline scenario

Simple prediction API for [sentiment analysis](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) on CPU.
This transformer is loaded into memory using the transformers and PyTorch libraries.

## üíæ Installation

### Manual deploy on Cloud Run (GCP)

To deploy this image to GCP, you need the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). You can find more information on how to install it here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install.

Navigate to the FastAPI-transformer-baseline directory.

```bash
cd FastAPI-transformer-baseline
```

Run gcloud init to update your information and select the necessary project.

```bash
gcloud init
```

Once this is done, you can start building the image with [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build). For more information, check the documentation: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs

First make a cloudbuild.yaml file (For the content see below üëá)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `{project_id}` with your [GCP Project ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects). Otherwise this snippit won't work.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "build-image"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "build",
        "--tag",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_transformer_baseline:latest",
        ".",
      ]
  - id: "push-image"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "push",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_transformer_baseline:latest",
      ]
    waitFor: ["build-image"]
  - id: "deploy-image"
    name: "gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk"
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args:
      [
        "run",
        "deploy",
        "fastapi-baseline",
        "--image",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_transformer_baseline:latest",
        "--region",
        "your_region",
        "--port",
        "80"
        "--set-env-vars",
        "APP_NAME=Sentiment-Analysis,API_TASK=sentiment-analysis,API_TASK_MODEL=distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
        "--memory",
        "4Gi",
        "--cpu",
        "2"
      ]
    waitFor: ["push-image"]

```

Run the following command to build and deploy this service to cloud run.

```bash
gcloud builds submit . --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

Congratulations, your service is ready ü•≥.
