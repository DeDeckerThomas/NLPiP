# FastAPI Benchmark API

Benchmark API for [Sentiment analysis](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) on the baseline, CPU and GPU scenario.

## üíæ Installation

### Manual deploy on Cloud Run (GCP)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have all the scenarios set up


To deploy this image to GCP, you need the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). You can find more information on how to install it here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Navigate to the FastAPI-transformer-baseline directory.

```bash
cd FastAPI-transformer-baseline
```

Run gcloud init to update your information and select the necessary project.

```bash
gcloud init
```

For the benchmark API, you need a VPC connector to access the Kubernetes cluster. Please fill in the missing parameters with your parameters. If you need more information, go check the documentation: https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access.

```
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create vpc-connector \
--region "your preferred region" \
--subnet "your preferred subnet" \
--min-instances 2 \
--max-instances 3 \
```

You will also need a scenarios.json configuration file and Google service account credentials json file.

The scenarios file is simple and you can create it yourself. 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to fill in the endpoints! You can find the endpoints on Google Cloud.

```json
{
  "baseline": {
    "endpoint": "baseline-endpoint",
    "backend_type": "fastapi"
  },
  "fast-cpu": {
    "endpoint": "internal ip of cpu service",
    "backend_type": "triton"
  },
  "fast-gpu": {
    "endpoint": "internal ip of gpu service",
    "backend_type": "triton"
  }
}

```

For the credentials file, you will have to create a service account and add the invoker role to it.
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create fastapi-baseline-app
```

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding {project_id} \ 
--member="serviceAccount:fastapi-baseline-app@{your_project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" 
--role="roles/run.invoker"
```

Then you can create a Google credentials json file with the following command.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create creds.json --iam-account=fastapi-baseline-app@calm-flames-337807.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Now you have both files, you can add them as secrets. Run the following commands.

```bash
gcloud secrets create fastapi-benchmark-scenarios --data-file="path to your scenarios file"
```

```bash
gcloud secrets create fastapi-baseline-app-creds --data-file="path to your service account credentials file"
```


Once this is done, you can start building the image with [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build). For more information, check the documentation: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs.

First make a cloudbuild.yaml file (For the content see below üëá)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `{project_id}` with your [GCP Project ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects). Otherwise this snippit won't work. Otherwise, all parameters are filled in.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "build-image"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "build",
        "--tag",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_benchmark:latest",
        ".",
      ]
  - id: "push-image"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "push",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_benchmark:latest",
      ]
    waitFor: ["build-image"]
  - id: "deploy-image"
    name: "gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk"
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args:
      [
        "run",
        "deploy",
        "fastapi-baseline",
        "--image",
        "gcr.io/{project_id}/fastapi_benchmark:latest",
        "--region",
        "your_region",
        "--port",
        "80"
        "--memory",
        "4Gi",
        "--cpu",
        "2",
        "--vpc-connector",
        "vpc-connector",
        "--set-env-vars",
        "APP_NAME=Benchmark API,WARM_UP_RATE=10,BENCHMARK_RATE=100,DEFAULT_BENCHMARK_BATCH_SIZE=32,DEFAULT_BENCHMARK_INPUT_DATA=Hello everyone!,SCENARIOS_FILE=/app/scenarios/fastapi-benchmark-scenarios,GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/secrets/fastapi-baseline-app-creds",
        "--set-secrets",
        "/app/scenarios/fastapi-benchmark-scenarios=fastapi-benchmark-scenarios:latest,/app/secrets/fastapi-baseline-app-creds=fastapi-baseline-app-creds:latest"
      ]
    waitFor: ["push-image"]

```

Run the following command to build and deploy this service to cloud run.

```bash
gcloud builds submit . --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

Congratulations, your service is ready ü•≥.
